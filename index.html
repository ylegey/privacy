A few tips for your listing:
Title Suggestion: Since the original didn't have a specific title, I used "Roll Cube: Infinite Adventure." If you have a specific name (e.g., Cube Dash or Rolling Legend), let me know and I can swap it.

Keywords: I used "one-finger gameplay," "parkour," and "reflexes," which are high-traffic search terms for casual mobile games.
